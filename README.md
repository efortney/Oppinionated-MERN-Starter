# Project Set Up 

There a few steps you will need to take to use this starter:
1. Ensure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - Check your install by running the command `node -v` inside of your terminal. 
2. In your terminal, run the command `cd so-clone`.
3. Once you are inside of the project, you can now run the application. Use the command `npm run start:dev` and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
